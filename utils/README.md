### PRE-PROCESSING
Run the preprocess script - but make sure to change the directory within this script to point to where your data is located. This file expects the data to be organized in the tree structure where there's a directory of labels, and under each label is a list of mp4 files. This script will output the *.npy files in that same location. This output will have the shape of [num_frames, size, size, channels] where size = 244 and channels = 3 (RGB). This script randomly takes a crop from the original image frame, and also scales pixel values to [-1, 1]. The num_frames is not always standard as some files have more than 250 and some have much less. The original videos were sampled at 25 frames a second as the original authors of 'Quo Vadis' did.
